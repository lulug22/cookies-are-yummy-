	<h1> Healthy Recipes for Dessert! </h1>


	<p>These recipes are my all time favorite! Some are harder than others. I hope you enjoy making them.</p>

<p>A key for some alternatives in baking!</p>

<li>Flax eggs: (1 tablespoon ground flax seeds + 2.5 tablespoons of water)
Whisk together and let sit for a minute.</li>	
	<li>Applesause instead of olive oil. Using applesause instead of oilve oil, makes the blondies more dense, instead of airy. Choosing which one you want to use is completely up to you. </li>	
	<li>Oat flour/coconut flour instead of almond flour. This alternative barely makes a difference in the texture and taste. Oat and coconut flour is a great nut-free alternative. </li>	
	<li>cashew butter instead of tahini. This does not make a difference in texture, but probably make a small difference in taste. </li>
